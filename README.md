# Internship
My projects during the internship at the IDLab of Ghent University.

The repository consists of three projects: 
<br><br><b>Deepsets</b>, a new neural network to train our agent. This is a neural network architecture promising to be scalable, meaning that you can train it in a smaller, less complex and computationally intensive environment and then apply it in a different, bigger one, without having to retrain 
<br><br><b>Predictions</b>,  where we added predictions of certain metrics in the agent's observation space
<br><br><b>Stable</b>, which is the version of the project developed in the gym-hpa paper (with some modifications).
<br><br><i>NOTE: The imports work using the run button in PyCharm in Windows, for the run.py in the main directory of each sub-project.
If you want to run it using the </i>python3 run.py<i> command in the
terminal, you must change the directory of some imports (more specifically the </i>'from gym_hpa_"project" ').
